HI

OSU Mappack Downloader
=======================
1. Place all your beatmap links (one per line) in links.txt
2. Run main.py
3. Log in using your osu! account
4. Choose a folder name
5. All .osz maps will be downloaded and zipped for you


YOU NEED OSU! SUPPORTER TAG TO RUN THE SCRIPT
or else this will not work, it will return "error: HTTP 403"

Only works with valid osu! client credentials

You might need to install some libraries if you dont have them

Enjoy!
